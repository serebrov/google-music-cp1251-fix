Description
    This script allows to fix a broken cp-1251 encoding in Google Music songs.
    If you music had mp3 tags in cp-1251 and it is uploaded to Google Music then
    you will get unreadable song names / albums / etc.

    Probably this script can be modified to fix other encodings too, but this is not tested.

Usage:

* New version is implemented in js
* To run it you need to inject fix script and dependencies into the google music page
* Open google music page 
* Open javascript console and insert following code:

    var head = document.getElementsByTagName('head').item(0);
    var script = document.createElement('script');
    script.setAttribute('type', 'text/javascript');
    script.setAttribute('src', 'https://raw.github.com/sebgoo/google-music-cp1251-fix/master/gmusic_js/require.js');
    script.setAttribute('data-main', 'https://raw.github.com/sebgoo/google-music-cp1251-fix/master/gmusic_js/gmusic.js');
    head.appendChild(script);

* Script can be embedded permanently using browser extension like Personalized Web for Chrome:
 * Add a new rule
 * Set URL to ^https://play.google.com/music/
 * Insert Javascript block shown above
* Find the `FIX ENCODING` button, click it to start a process.

[OLD VERSION] Install

    Script uses selenium to do the job. To run it you need to install Python, Selenium 
    and selenium python client library (see Install section below).

1. Python 2.7 - http://www.python.org/download/

2. Python setup tools:
        http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/d/distribute/distribute-0.6.15.tar.gz
    After extraction to a local dir do from command line: 
        python setup.py install

3. Install selenium python package:
        http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/s/selenium/selenium-2.0b3.tar.gz

    After extraction to a local dir do from command line: 
        python setup.py install

Usage
1. Configure script - open fix-cp1251.py, set:
    LOGIN_EMAIL="your_email_here"

2. Run script:
    python fix-cp1251.py

    - after browser window is opened and your email is shown, enter your password
    - during processing the script will report progress, where:
      [\/] - scrolling to start song (when START_SONG > 0)
      [?] - searching for songs
      . - song was skipped 
      + - song was processed
    - at the end whether "failed after: XXX songs" (not finished processing) 
      or "done: 5377 songs" (finished) will be shown

3. If the script fails:
    - check error message "failed after: XXX songs"
    - set new START_SONG value in the fix-cp1251.py (use XXX from the error message above)
    - run script again

Notes
1. In Windows works with Google Chrome browser, in Ubuntu - with Firefox
2. Works more stable in Ubuntu (I had selenium hangs in Windows more often, so 
   you may need to run script many times in Windows, see p.4 above)
3. Firefox can show warning that script is not responding. Allow it continue.
