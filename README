Description
    This script allows to fix a broken cp-1251 encoding in Google Music songs.
    If you music had mp3 tags in cp-1251 and it is uploaded to Google Music then
    you will get unreadable song names / albums / etc.

    Probably this script can be modified to fix other encodings too, but this is not tested.

    Script uses selenium to do the job. To run it you need to install Python, Selenium 
    and selenium python client library (see Install section below).


Install
1. Python 2.7 - http://www.python.org/download/

2. Python setup tools:
        http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/d/distribute/distribute-0.6.15.tar.gz
    After extraction to a local dir do from command line: 
        python setup.py install

3. Install selenium python package:
        http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/s/selenium/selenium-2.0b3.tar.gz

    After extraction to a local dir do from command line: 
        python setup.py install

4. Download the Selenium Remote control server:
    http://selenium.googlecode.com/files/selenium-server-standalone-2.0b3.jar

Usage
1. Run the selenium server, do from command line
    java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.0b3.jar

2. Configure script - open fix-cp1251.py, set:
    LOGIN_EMAIL="your_email_here"

3. Run script:
    python fix-cp1251.py

    - after browser window is opened and your email is shown, enter your password

4. If the script fails:
    - check error message "failed after: XXX songs"
    - set new START_SONG value in the fix-cp1251.py
    - run script again

Notes
1. Tested on selenium 2.0b3 version only, most probably will not work on newer
   versions since selenium interface changed.
2. In Windows works with Google Chrome browser, in Ubuntu - with Firefox
3. Works more stable in Ubuntu (I had selenium hangs in Windows more often, so 
   you may need to run script many times in Windows, see p.4 above)
4. Firefox can show warning that script is not responding. Allow it continue.
